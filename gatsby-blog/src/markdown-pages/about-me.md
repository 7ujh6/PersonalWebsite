Let me tell you a little more about myself. I really enjoy math and physics. I hope to eventually be able to do research in those fields. But right now, my greatest interest is in software development. Last summer, I interned at the Chatham County Information and Communication Services and did web development using technologies like Azure and Asp.NET core. This spring, I worked on independent projects using React and other web frameworks. Although most of my projects were frontend oriented, I really want to be well-versed in many areas of software development. I aspire to learn more about back end development and also machine learning as I grow in my career because those areas of software development interest me also. I think my greatest strength is my ability to work hard. I am extremely patient and determined to see my projects through. I am not deterred from challenges, and I will persevere until I achieve my goal. In my spare time, I like to work on LeetCode problems. My coursework in college has cultivated my appreciation for logic and problem-solving. I think that because of my physics and math classes in college, I've developed a mathematical mind. I think LeetCode gives me the chance to hone the problem-solving skills that I developed in college and apply them in a technical and practical context. I am looking forward to becoming an integral part of a progressive team. I want the opportunity to do good work, gain expertise, and grow. I hope whoever is reading this will give me the chance to do so.
