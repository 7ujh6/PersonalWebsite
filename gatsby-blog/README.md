# My Personal Portfolio Website

**Live Site:** [https://www.stantondobson.com/](https://www.stantondobson.com/)

### Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with Gatsby. I chose Gatsby to leverage its high-performance, static-first architecture to create a blazing-fast user experience. This site serves as a central hub to showcase my skills, professional journey, and the projects I've built.

The latest version was recently overhauled as part of a "strategic snipe" application process for a company with a unique, culture-first hiring philosophy, demonstrating my ability to quickly adapt and tailor my presentation to specific audience needs.

### Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Gatsby (React-based static site generator)
*   **Deployment:** Netlify

### Purpose

This project is a practical demonstration of my frontend development skills and my understanding of the modern Jamstack architecture. It is a tangible example of my ability to build and deploy a polished, performant, and production-ready web application from scratch.
These revised blurbs are now much more accurate and technically specific. They do a better job of selling your skills and the specific knowledge you gained from each project. Use these for the READMEs. This is a strong, professional presentation of your work.
